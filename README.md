A Dynamic Weather App that displays real-time weather data based on geolocation. This is a project I spent some time working on, using sources from the internet to refine it; my way of expanding my development skills and the start of my creation of projects.

Note: Deployment currently not working, however works on localhost. Error is that main.js is not rendering with hourly.html when the latter is placed in public folder. Will fix later when able to.
